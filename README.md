# Reverse Shell File Infiltration Tool

<br>

## **IMPORTANT: This tool currently only supports file infiltration**

<br>

## Overview

This program is a simple Linux tool that allows files to be infiltrated into Windows and Linux systems through a reverse shell. The current development state only supports file uploads to the target system, while **file exfiltration is not yet implemented**. The program leverages active reverse shells to transmit files by simulating user input.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Supports file uploads to both Windows and Linux systems.
- **Reverse Shell Utilization**: Infiltrates files through active reverse shells by simulating user input.
- **Windows Support**: Currently, only PowerShell is supported as the interface on Windows systems.

## Installation

To compile the program, execute the following commands AS ROOT:

```
gcc -c base64.c -o base.o
gcc file_upload.c base64.o -o file_upload
```

## Usage

The program offers a simple interface for infiltrating files through a reverse shell. Here are some basic commands for usage:

- To display help, execute:

```
./file_upload -h
```

- Example usage with a specific tty connection (e.g., /dev/pts/3):

```
./file_upload /dev/pts/3
```

## Note on tty Connection Usage

To find the correct tty connection for the reverse shell, run the following command in the terminal:

```
tty
```

This command will display the current terminal, which can then be used for file transfer.

## Current Development Status

This tool is still under development. As of now, only file infiltration is possible. File exfiltration will be supported in future versions.
